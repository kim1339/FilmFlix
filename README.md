# *FilmFlix: A Film Catalogue App*

FilmFlix is an application that allows you to keep track of your favorite films. 

### Features:
FilmFlix allows users to:
- easily keep track of their cinema collection, allowing them to add movies to a catalogue, including
 information and other metadata like title, genre, release year, director, cast, etc. as well as add
 their personal ratings and reviews.
- search and filter through their catalogue based on various settings like genre, title, rating, year, cast member, etc.
- remove movies from their catalogue.

### Users:
- This application is useful for cinema lovers, movie buffs, and practically anyone who is looking for an easy and
 convenient way to manage and keep track of their cinema/media collection.
 
### Motivation behind the project:
- As it is becoming much less common to use physical DVDs, and more common to instead watch films
and TV shows through external streaming services/channels, it is becoming a challenge to keep track of our favorite
films and shows. Thus, as an avid movie-lover (and **amateur** critic who likes to discuss
film reviews and recommendations with others), I was motivated to develop such an application :)
